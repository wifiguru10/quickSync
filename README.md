# quickSync
Syncs the config of one network to other networks. (syslog/netflow)

run the ./quickSync.py scrypt

Enter Organization Name:
<Your Org Name> ex: 'Miles Organization'

Enter SOURCE Name:
<Enter your network name>  ex: 'Golden-Network'

And that's it, it'll ask you if you want to apply syslog/netflow settings to each network in that same org. Pretty simple.
